Personal loan approval is generally based on just a few key criteria such as employment and income history, credit score and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.

The widely held misconception is that personal loans involve a daunting application process that includes completing a stack of paperwork and meeting a long list of requirements to get approved for funding. While qualification requirements vary based on the lender, approval is far easier than applying for a mortgage and involves less documentation.

You can usually apply online in just a few minutes with most lenders. Youâ€™ll typically need to fill out a brief questionnaire and upload proof of income and employment, address and documentation that confirms your identity.
