rivervalleyloans.com is another lender with one of the more competitive starting interest rates in the personal loan market. You can access from $2,000 and $50,000, and the starting APR is just 8.99 percent. TD Bank caps the interest rate on its Fit Loan solution at 23.99 percent, and you’ll get between 36 and 60 months to repay what you borrow.

Like Barclays loans, you’ll also steer clear of fees when you take out a loan with TD bank, and funds are typically available as soon as one business day. Plus, you can check your rate without impacting your credit score, and you don’t need perfect credit to qualify for funding.
